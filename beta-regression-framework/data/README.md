# Data Sources

This directory is for data files used in the beta regression analysis.

## Synthetic Data
The simulations in this paper generate synthetic data based on published degradation patterns from:
- Bahmani et al. (2023) - Young Face Aging dataset patterns
- Deb et al. (2018) - Children Longitudinal Face dataset patterns

## Real Dataset Access
For researchers seeking to validate these methods on real data:
- **Children Longitudinal Face (CLF)**: Contact authors of Deb et al. (2018)
- **Young Face Aging (YFA)**: Contact authors of Bahmani et al. (2023)

## Data Generation
The simulation code to generate synthetic datasets matching the published patterns is available in the supplementary notebooks:
- `supplementary/notebooks/StoreyAaron_BetaRegression.ipynb`
- `supplementary/notebooks/StoreyAaron_ChildFaceAnalysis.ipynb`

## Note
This directory is intentionally empty as the paper uses synthetic data generated during analysis. Real datasets require permission from the original authors.
